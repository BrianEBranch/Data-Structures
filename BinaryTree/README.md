# Binary Tree!
#### How the different traversals work:
* Pre-order Traversal: Nodes are visited in the order of the root, left subtree, and then the right subtree. This traversal is useful for creating a copy of the tree.
* In-order Traversal: Nodes are visited in the order of the left subtree, root, and then the right subtree. This traversal results in sorted elements for a binary search tree.
* Post-order Traversal: Nodes are visited in the order of the left subtree, right subtree, and then the root. This traversal is often used for deleting nodes from the tree.
* Breadth-First: Nodes are visited level by level, starting from the root. All nodes at the same depth are processed before moving on to the next level.
