# Sorting Algorithms!
#### Insertion Sort:
* Average Case Time Complexity: O(n^2)
* Best Case Time Complexity (already sorted input): O(n)
* Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n^2)
* Space Complexity: O(1)
#### Merge Sort:
* Average Case Time Complexity: O(n log n)
* Best Case Time Complexity: O(n log n)
* Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n log n)
* Space Complexity: O(n) - additional space for the merge step
#### Quick Sort:
* Average Case Time Complexity: O(n log n)
* Best Case Time Complexity (with good pivot selection): O(n log n)
* Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n^2) (rare, but can occur with poor pivot selection strategies)
* Space Complexity: O(log n) - in-place partitioning
#### Heap Sort:
* Average Case Time Complexity: O(n log n)
* Best Case Time Complexity: O(n log n)
* Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n log n)
* Space Complexity: O(1) - in-place heap construction
